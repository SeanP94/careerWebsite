# careerWebsite

---

The primary use for this project is to expand my Django skills and build a website that utilizes it's many aspects.

My planned Stack is to:
> Containerize the code into Docker
> Use Django for the site.
> Database will be PostgreSQL (Will start with sqlite for lease complexity)
> HTMX will handle the webfrontend AJAX hooks and such (I probably won't touch Javascript until I HAVE too.) 
> HTML | CSS & Bootstrap

This site will evolve into 1 of 2 things:

    - A pet raising simulator. That way I can utilize drawing some sprites that I can reuse later. Something I've wanted to do for awhile.

    - A data research platform. The site would be a front end for me to utilize some Machine Learning models I'll write. Probably relating to public data. In this instance I'd utilize another server that would have data passed to it through a messaging queue like redis/celery to test and output predictions.
