I decided to finally bite the bullet, and focus on some web development again.  
This will be a showcase website, and for now I'm going to just be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and Bootstrap.  

The primary focus is to learn Flask, and get familiar again with CSS and HTML. Since I'm not planning on becoming a web developer, I'm going to use Bootstrap to do a lot of my heavy lifting in the design department.

TODO:
- Relearn SQLAlchemy and integrate it and fill the DB (Temporarily use Sqlite, use Postgres)
- - Then go back and create a better Resume html form
- Create Website typical layout html
- - Build main page (Make it kind of like a Blog)

---
DONE:
- Resume Layout complete!
- - TODO: Awaiting SQL integration before making HTML more templated.
