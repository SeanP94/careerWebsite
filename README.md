# careerWebsite

---

I decided to finally bite the bullet, and focus on some web development again.  
This will be a showcase website, and for now I'm going to just be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and Bootstrap.  

The primary focus is to learn Flask, and get familiar again with CSS and HTML. Since I'm not planning on becoming a web developer, I'm going to use Bootstrap to do a lot of my heavy lifting in the design department.

TODO:
- Build the main page and resume portion of website. ETA is hopefully end of July.
